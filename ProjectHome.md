This tool is a successor to my original stand-alone HTTPAnalyzer which was a first attempt at creating such a tool. I basically needed a tool that had a CLI and could give me information readily about websites on the Internet. I also developed it to be useful as a web scraper. Because it is a command-line tool, you can easily automate tasks in batch or [PowerShell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell) scripts. The tool is currently only available in .NET 3.5.
